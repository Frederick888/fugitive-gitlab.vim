INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive-gitlab*

This plugin to fugitive allows the |fugitive-:Gbrowse| command to
work with gitlab.com or your private gitlab instance.

See |fugitive| for documentation on |fugitive-:Gbrowse| documentation.

Additionally, this plugin interacts with the Gitlab V4 API to provide
A couple of commands for interacting with gitlab snippets.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/snippets.html and
https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/project_snippets.html

The gitlab snippet URL used is determined from the repository remote in the
same fashion as :Gbrowse

CONFIGUTATION                                   *fugitive-gitlab-config*

To use this plugin with gitlab.com, no configuration is required.

To use this plugin with a private gitlab.com, add the following to your
.vimrc

  let g:fugitive_gitlab_domains = ['https://gitlab.mydomain.com']

If you are intending to use the snippets commands, you will need a gitlab
api key.

  let g:gitlab_api_keys = {"gitab.com": "myapitoken"}

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-gitlab-commands*

                                        *fugitive-gitlab-:GitlabProjectSnippet*
:GitlabProjectSnippet[!]

        Pastes the current buffer to a new project snippet for this gitlab
        repository.
        Opens a new browser page with the new url.
        If ! is supplied, the URL is instead copied to the clipboard.
        Requires that gitlab snippets are turned on for this project.

:{range}GitlabProjectSnippet[!]

        Same as above, but only pastes the current range of selected text.

:GitlabProjectSnippet @{remote}
        
        Force the gitlab instance to be the one specified by {remote}.
        Otherwise, it will use the instance specified by the default remote
        as calculated by fugitive.

                                            *fugitive-gitlab-:GitlabUserSnippet*
:GitlabUserSnippet[!]

        Same as |:GitlabProjectSnippet| but pastes to a user snippet instead of
        a project snippet.

:{range}GitlabUserSnippet[!]

        Same as GitlabProjectSnippet

:GitlabUserSnippet @{remote}
        
        Force the gitlab instance to be the one specified by {remote}.
        Otherwise, it will use the instance specified by the default remote
        as calculated by fugitive.
